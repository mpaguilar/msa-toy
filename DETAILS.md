# Multi-Step Agent (MSA) Application Analysis

## Core Purpose and Problem Solved

The Multi-Step Agent (MSA) is an AI-powered question answering system that can handle complex queries requiring multiple steps and resources to answer. It implements the ReAct
(Reasoning + Action) pattern to iteratively think, act, and observe until it can provide a comprehensive answer to user queries.

The application addresses the limitation of single-step question answering by breaking down complex questions into sub-tasks, using various tools (like web search and
Wikipedia), managing working memory of gathered information, and synthesizing a final coherent response with confidence scoring and citations.

## Target Audience

The primary audience includes:
- Developers building AI agents and question-answering systems
- Researchers working on LLM-based reasoning systems
- Users requiring complex information gathering with source attribution

## Application Architecture Overview

The MSA follows a modular architecture with these key components:

1. **Controller Layer** - Orchestrates the ReAct cycle (think, act, observe)
2. **Memory Management** - Persistent working memory tracking facts, relationships, and reasoning state
3. **Tool System** - Extensible interface for various information gathering tools
4. **Orchestration Layer** - Tool selection, conflict resolution, and confidence scoring
5. **Synthesis Engine** - Combines facts into coherent answers with citations
6. **LLM Integration** - Multiple LLM clients for different purposes (thinking, action selection, completion)

## Key Features

- **ReAct Pattern Implementation**: Cyclical process of thought, action, and observation
- **Working Memory Management**: Persistent state tracking across reasoning steps
- **Tool Chaining**: Dynamic selection and execution of appropriate tools
- **Confidence Scoring**: Multi-factor confidence assessment for answers
- **Conflict Detection**: Identification and resolution of contradictory information
- **Citation System**: Source attribution for all claims
- **Temporal Reasoning**: Analysis of time-based relationships between facts
- **Rate Limiting Compliance**: Token bucket algorithm with adaptive throttling
- **Caching Strategy**: Persistent caching with time-based expiration
- **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Failure threshold management with automatic reset

## Core Workflows

1. **Query Processing**: User submits query → Controller initializes memory → ReAct cycle begins
2. **Reasoning Cycle**: Think phase → Action selection → Tool execution → Observation processing → Completion check
3. **Information Synthesis**: Facts gathered → Redundancy elimination → Narrative construction → Confidence scoring → Citation generation
4. **Response Generation**: Final answer with confidence metrics and sources

## Tool System Implementation Details

### Base Tool Interface
The `msa/tools/base.py` file defines the abstract base class `ToolInterface` that all tools must implement:
- `execute(query: str) -> ToolResponse`: Execute tool with standardized input/output
- `validate_response(response: dict) -> bool`: Check if response contains valid data

The `ToolResponse` model standardizes all tool outputs with:
- `tool_name`: Name of the tool that generated the response
- `response_data`: Dictionary of structured response data
- `metadata`: Additional information about the response
- `raw_response`: The original raw response from the tool
- `content`: Formatted content string in Markdown format
- `timestamp`: When the response was generated

### Web Search Tool
The `msa/tools/web_search.py` file implements the `WebSearchTool` using SerpAPI's Google Search:
- Requires `SERPAPI_API_KEY` environment variable
- Uses rate limiting with default 10 requests per second
- Caches results with normalized query keys
- Processes search results into formatted Markdown content
- Returns top 5 results with title, link, and snippet
- Handles errors gracefully with descriptive error messages

### Wikipedia Tool
The `msa/tools/wikipedia.py` file implements the `WikipediaTool` using LangChain's WikipediaRetriever:
- Uses rate limiting with default 5 requests per second
- Caches results with normalized query keys
- Processes Wikipedia documents into formatted Markdown content
- Combines multiple document contents with titles as headers
- Handles errors gracefully with descriptive error messages

### Cache Manager
The `msa/tools/cache.py` file implements the `CacheManager` with:
- File-based persistent caching in `msa/cache` directory
- Configurable time-to-live (TTL) with default 1 hour
- Query normalization using MD5 hashing for consistent keys
- Automatic cleanup of expired cache entries
- Cache warming functionality for frequently accessed data
- Usage of `msa/config.py` for cache configuration

### Rate Limiter
The `msa/tools/rate_limiter.py` file implements the `RateLimiter` using token bucket algorithm:
- Configurable requests per second and bucket capacity
- Adaptive throttling capabilities
- Endpoint-specific token management
- Automatic token refill based on time elapsed
- Request queuing with sleep-based throttling
- Usage statistics tracking for monitoring

### Circuit Breaker
The `msa/tools/circuit_breaker.py` file implements the `CircuitBreaker` pattern:
- Three states: CLOSED, OPEN, HALF_OPEN
- Configurable failure threshold and timeout
- Automatic state transitions with half-open testing
- Function execution protection with circuit breaker logic
- State monitoring capabilities
