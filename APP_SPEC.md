We're creating a multi-step agent which is able to answer simple questions which may require several resources to answer.

# Agent Framework

## ReAct Pattern Implementation

The agent will follow a cyclical process:

 1 Thought: Analyze the question and current state
 2 Action: Select and execute a tool
 3 Observation: Process the tool's result
 4 Repeat until sufficient information is gathered

This will be implemented using LangChain's AgentExecutor with a custom ReAct prompt template that emphasizes step-by-step reasoning.

## LLM Controller Details

* There will be a selection of models, strong and weak, for different uses
* Controller will receive:
    * Original question
    * Working memory state
    * Available tools list
    * Recent observations
* Controller outputs structured decisions using Pydantic models for:
    * Next action selection
    * Refined question for tool use
    * Completion determination

## Working Memory Structure

Persistent state tracking including:

* Original query and refined versions
* Execution history (actions taken, timestamps)
* Accumulated observations
* Current hypothesis/answer draft
* Confidence scores for partial answers
* Tool call results with metadata

# Orchestration Layer

## Step Planning Implementation

* Query Decomposition: Break complex questions into sub-questions
* Dependency Mapping: Identify which steps must happen before others
* Execution Strategy: Determine optimal order of tool usage
* Progress Tracking: Monitor which information gaps remain

## Tool Selection Mechanism

* Intent Classification: Use LLM to categorize query type
* Tool Relevance Scoring: Rank tools based on query keywords and context
* Dynamic Tool Chaining: Adjust tool selection based on intermediate results
* Cost/Benefit Analysis: Consider API costs vs. information value

## Result Synthesis Process

* Information Extraction: Pull relevant facts from tool responses
* Cross-Validation: Check consistency across sources
* Confidence Scoring: Rate reliability of each piece of information
* Answer Refinement: Iteratively improve answer as more data arrives

## Tool Adapters

Standardized Interface Design

All tools will implement a common interface:

```
class ToolInterface:
    def execute(self, query: str) -> ToolResponse:
        """Execute tool with standardized input/output"""

    def validate_response(self, response: dict) -> bool:
        """Check if response contains valid data"""
```

### Each adapter will:

* Handle authentication and API key management
* Convert generic queries to API-specific formats
* Parse responses into standardized data structures
* Extract relevant information and discard noise

## Error Handling Strategy

* Retry Logic: Exponential backoff for transient failures
* Fallback Mechanisms: Alternative tools for similar queries
* Graceful Degradation: Continue with partial information when possible
* Error Classification: Distinguish between temporary/network vs. permanent/data errors

## Rate Limiting Compliance

* Token Bucket System: Track API usage quotas
* Request Queuing: Delay requests when limits approached
* Adaptive Throttling: Adjust request frequency based on response headers
* Usage Analytics: Monitor and report on API consumption patterns

# Knowledge Integration

## Cross-Reference Implementation

* Entity Resolution: Identify when different sources refer to same concepts
* Temporal Alignment: Handle time-sensitive information consistency
* Source Authority Weighting: Prefer sources based on domain expertise
* Contradiction Detection: Flag conflicting information for review

## Confidence Scoring Model

### Factors to consider:

* Source credibility (peer-reviewed vs. blog post)
* Recency of information
* Consistency across multiple sources
* Specificity vs. generality of claims
* Completeness of answer coverage

### Conflict Resolution Process

* Detection: Identify contradictory claims
* Investigation: Use additional tools to gather context
* Prioritization: Weight claims by source reliability
* Synthesis: Create nuanced answer acknowledging uncertainties

# Reliability Features

## Circuit Breaker Pattern

* Failure Threshold: Trip breaker after N consecutive failures
* Timeout Period: Automatic reset after specified duration
* Half-Open State: Test service availability before full restore
* Fallback Responses: Provide cached/stale data when services down

## Caching Strategy

* Query-Based Caching: Store results by normalized query strings
* Time-Based Expiration: Different TTLs for different data types
* Cache Warming: Proactively refresh frequently accessed data
* Cache Invalidation: Clear outdated information based on events

## Fallback Mechanisms

* Tool Substitution: Wikipedia search when web search fails
* Reduced Functionality Mode: Continue with available tools
* Degraded Response Quality: Acknowledge limitations in final answer
* User Notification: Inform users about service limitations

## Timeout Management

* Per-Tool Timeouts: Different limits for different services
* Cumulative Timeout: Overall limit for entire query processing
* Progress Reporting: Inform users of delays without failing
* Partial Results: Return what's available when timeouts occur

## Response Generation

Multi-Source Synthesis Engine

* Information Aggregation: Combine relevant facts from all sources
* Redundancy Elimination: Remove duplicate information
* Narrative Construction: Create coherent answer from discrete facts
* Uncertainty Expression: Clearly indicate confidence levels

## Citation System

* Source Attribution: Link each claim to its origin
* Timestamp Tracking: Record when information was retrieved
* Version Control: Handle updates to previously retrieved information
* User Verification: Enable users to check original sources

## Confidence Level Reporting

* Quantitative Scores: Numerical confidence ratings (0-100)
* Qualitative Descriptions: Human-readable confidence categories
* Evidence Strength: Number and quality of supporting sources
* Limitation Disclosure: Acknowledge gaps in available information

# Working memory details

# Core Structure

The working memory will be implemented as a persistent data structure that tracks the agent's state throughout the reasoning process, completely separate from the LLM's context
window.

## Memory Components

These are proposed memory structures. They may be modified as needed.

### Query Management
```
class QueryState:
    original_query: str
    refined_queries: List[str]
    query_history: List[QueryRefinement]
    current_focus: str
```

### Execution History

```
class ExecutionHistory:
    actions_taken: List[ActionRecord]
    timestamps: Dict[str, datetime]
    tool_call_sequence: List[ToolCall]
    intermediate_results: List[ToolResponse]
```

### Information Store
```
class InformationStore:
    facts: Dict[str, Fact]
    relationships: Dict[str, Relationship]
    sources: Dict[str, SourceMetadata]
    confidence_scores: Dict[str, float]
```

### Reasoning State
```
class ReasoningState:
    current_hypothesis: str
    answer_draft: str
    information_gaps: List[str]
    next_steps: List[str]
    termination_criteria_met: bool
```

## Implementation Approach

### Persistent Storage

* Use an in-memory data structure (Python classes/objects) that persists for the duration of the agent's task
* Structure as a Pydantic model for type safety and serialization
* Include methods for updating, querying, and summarizing the state

### Memory Operations

#### State Updates

* Add new observations from tool responses
* Update confidence scores based on new evidence
* Track provenance of all information
* Maintain temporal ordering of events

#### State Queries

* Retrieve relevant facts for decision making
* Get current information gaps
* Access historical tool calls and their results
* Summarize current state for LLM controller

#### Memory Management

* Implement size limits to prevent unbounded growth
* Prune irrelevant information when necessary
* Maintain essential context while discarding noise

### Memory Serialization

#### JSON-Based Representation

The working memory will be fully serializable to/from JSON for:

* Debugging and inspection
* Checkpointing long-running processes
* Inter-process communication if needed
* Human-readable state tracking

#### Versioning

* Include version information for backward compatibility
* Track schema changes over time
* Enable migration of older memory states


## Integration with Agent Components

### Controller Interface

The LLM controller will receive a summarized view of working memory:

* Set initial state variables

### Update Process

* Validate new information before storing
* Update confidence scores based on source reliability
* Maintain consistency between related facts
* Track when information was added
